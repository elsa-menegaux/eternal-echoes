## 🕹️ About the game

Eternal Echoes is a rogue-like game, created for the COMP602 paper at AUT in 2024. 
We are four students to have worked on this project : Jeffery T, Joshua H, Sahil D and Elsa M. Together, we imagined this game around the concept of "Echoes", encountarable enemies that reflect the player's past self in a matrix environment. 

### Story
The game takes place in a computer-simulated environment, where the protagonist has been stuck and tries to escape to go back to their reality. As they try to leave, the simulation fights back : you will have to fight your way to freedom, even if it means you have to die and be reborn in the process. However, the more you progress through the levels, you start feeling strange : some of the enemies you encounter ... why do they look and fight exactly like you ?

### Features
In this game, the player is incarnated in a (slightly customizable) avatar. As you go through different maps that each contain a number of enemies, that get stronger the more the run progresses, you will be able to fight in a turn-based system, find items, and finally escape ... or be brought back to the lobby in an endless cycle of simulated life and death. Some of the potential enemies are "Echoes", a special type of enemy that reflects the player in almost all manners : same look and same stats. You will be able to save your progress and find a lobby area to breathe in, as well as manage your enventory, statistics of your avatar, and in-game economy to try and modulate gameplay.
