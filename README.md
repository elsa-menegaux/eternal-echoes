## 🕹️ About the game

Eternal Echoes is a rogue-like game, created for the COMP602 paper at AUT in 2024. We are four students to have worked on this project : Jeffery T, Joshua H, Sahil D and Elsa M. Together, we imagined this game around the concept of "Echoes", encountarable enemies that reflect the player's past self in a matrix environment. 
This game was created and built using Unity 2022.
